  "summary" : "This Quarkus guide covers how to utilize Java virtual threads in reactive messaging applications, specifically with Kafka. It details using the @RunOnVirtualThread annotation to offload message processing from event-loop or worker threads to virtual threads, enabling blocking operations without thread blocking. Important aspects include setup requirements like Java 19+, the necessary Maven or Gradle dependencies, and specific usage of @RunOnVirtualThread in message consumer methods. The guide also discusses configuring maximum concurrency for virtual thread-based processing.",

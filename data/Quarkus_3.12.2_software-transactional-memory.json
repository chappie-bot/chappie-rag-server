  "summary" : "This guide details the usage of Software Transactional Memory (STM) in Quarkus, highlighting its benefits for microservices and Kubernetes-native applications. It explains the differences and advantages over traditional JTA, incorporating concepts such as non-durability, concurrency control, modularity, and ease of use in application development. The guide also includes instructions for setting up STM with Quarkus, defining STM-aware classes, managing transaction boundaries, and offers a practical example through a quickstart guide.",

  "summary" : "This Quarkus guide describes the Observability Dev Services, which extend the Dev Services framework to support a full stack of observability tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Jaeger, using Testcontainers. It introduces the concept of Dev Resources, a flexible way to manage multiple observability tools in a development environment. The guide also explains how to configure and use these tools individually or as a combined stack, and provides guidance on setting the scope for dependencies to avoid including test libraries in production.",

  "categories" : [ "gRPC", "Virtual Threads", "Reactive Programming" ],
  "summary" : "This guide discusses how to utilize Java virtual threads in implementing gRPC services with Quarkus to allow blocking operations without blocking the platform thread. It explains using the `@RunOnVirtualThread` annotation in service methods to shift execution from event-loop or worker threads to virtual threads, suitable for JDK 19 or above. The guide includes configuration setups, example implementations, and a pertinent note on the limitations with streaming methods, recommending the Quarkus gRPC extension for optimal integration.",

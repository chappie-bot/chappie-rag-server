  "categories" : [ "web", "observability" ],
  "summary" : "The guide provides detailed walkthroughs on implementing fault tolerance in a Quarkus application using the SmallRye Fault Tolerance extension, which conforms to the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification. It covers setting up a Maven project, adding necessary dependencies, and specific fault-tolerance strategies including retries, timeouts, fallbacks, circuit breakers, and rate limits. The guide uses practical examples featuring a coffee shop application scenario to explain how each component works by demonstrating both success and failure cases. Additionally, tips on runtime configuration and integrating other Quarkus extensions are provided.",

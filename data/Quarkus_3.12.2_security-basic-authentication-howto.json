  "summary" : "The Quarkus document guide on enabling Basic authentication allows developers to secure their applications by allowing users to authenticate using a username and password. To implement this, one must install extensions that provide an Identity Provider for handling authentication data such as 'quarkus-elytron-security-jdbc', 'quarkus-elytron-security-ldap', or 'quarkus-security-jpa-reactive'. Steps covered include configuring properties in `application.properties` to activate basic authentication and manage users and roles securely, particularly for testing environments. The document also emphasizes storing sensitive data securely in a database for production and points to further guides for elaborate configurations with Jakarta Persistence.",

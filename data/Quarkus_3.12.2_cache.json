  "summary" : "This guide details how to improve the performance of Quarkus applications by caching results of expensive method calls in CDI-managed beans using annotations. It covers enabling caching with Caffeine, Infinispan, or Redis backends, creating a simple example with Maven, annotations for caching such as @CacheResult, and dealing with common cache configurations and operations. Additionally, the guide explains handling cache keys, purging caches programmatically or via annotations, and integrating cache metrics with Micrometers.",
